# CSS Float Challenge
The `float` CSS property places an element on the left or right side of its container, allowing text and inline elements to wrap around it. 

Your goal is to create a `styles.css` file and apply css to a new `layout-with-float.html` file so that the elements align to form a basic webframe, as depicted in the example below.

## Instructions
1. Clone this repo onto your own machine.  Open the `<username>-float-example` folder in VS code.
2. Create a new file called `layout-with-float.html`.
3. Copy all of the code from `layout-no-float.html` into `layout-with-float.html`.
4. Create a new file called `style.css`.
5. Link your `style.css` within the `<head>` of your `layout-with-float.html` document.
6. Style your html document appropriately!
7. When you're finished add all changes, commit them, then push to your personal repository titled `<username>-float-example`.
