# CSS Float Challenge
The `float` CSS property places an element on the left or right side of its container, allowing text and inline elements to wrap around it. 

Your goal is to create a `styles.css` file and apply css to a new `layout-with-float.html` file so that the elements align to form a basic webframe, as depicted in the example below.
